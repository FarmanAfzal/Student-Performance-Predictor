Student Performance Predictor

Preprocessing steps:
- Numerical imputation with median and scaling (StandardScaler)
- Categorical imputation with most frequent and OneHotEncoding (drop first)

Models used:
- Linear Regression for predicting G3 (final grade)
- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for pass/fail classification

Evaluation:
- Regression: MSE, RMSE, R2
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix
